Lab Assignment 3
Purpose: The purpose of this porgram is to simulate craps. 
	 It simply asks the user to enter 'r' to roll the 
	 dice then generates random numbers to simulate the
	 dice being rolled. The rules of the program mirror
	 the rules for craps



Comments: Im think my random number generation is predicaible. Not sure how to fix that.
